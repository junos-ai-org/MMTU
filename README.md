## 🧠 Introduction

Tables and table-based use cases play a crucial role in many real-world applications, such as spreadsheets, databases, and computational notebooks, which traditionally require expert-level users like data engineers, analysts, and database administrators to operate. Although LLMs have shown remarkable progress in working with tables, comprehensive benchmarking of such capabilities remains limited, often narrowly focusing on tasks like NL-to-SQL and Table-QA, while overlooking the broader spectrum of real-world tasks that professional users face today. 

We introduce **MMTU**, a large-scale benchmark with around **28K questions** across **25 real-world table tasks**, designed to comprehensively evaluate models ability to understand, reason, and manipulate real tables at the expert-level. These tasks are drawn from decades' worth of computer science research on tabular data, with a focus on complex table tasks faced by professional users. We show that MMTU require a combination of skills -- including table understanding, reasoning, and coding -- that remain challenging for today's frontier models, where even frontier reasoning models like OpenAI GPT-5 and DeepSeek
R1 score only around 69% and 57% respectively, suggesting significant room for improvement.

## 🛠️ Dataset Creation
MMTU was developed through the meticulous curation of 52 datasets across 25 task categories, each carefully labeled by computer science researchers, in decades’ worth of research on tabular data from communities such as data management (SIGMOD/VLDB), programming languages (PLDI/POPL), and web data (WWW/WSDM).  The benchmark emphasizes real-world, complex table tasks encountered by professional users—tasks that demand advanced skills in table understanding, coding, and reasoning. Plesae see the table below for key statistics of the benchmark, and please visit our 🤗 [Dataset](https://huggingface.co/datasets/MMTU-benchmark/MMTU) page for additional details.

## 🚀 Evaluate Your Model

⚠️ This benchmark involves automated code execution for some complex table tasks (e.g., for NL-2-SQL and data transformation). We recommend executing model-generated code in an isolated sandbox environment.


### Step 0: Download the Data

Download the original data from [OneDrive](https://1drv.ms/f/c/4eea81351af2d84b/Em8WdXGOGwBFnx92aN8ZKNEBYLCkJlkwzZYTlmkx3jUykg?e=pBb24n) and extract the contents.

### Step 1: Set Up Environment

```bash
export MMTU_HOME=<YOUR_DIRECTORY_PATH>
python3.11 -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### Step 2: Run Inference

MMTU supports the following API providers:
- OpenAI
- Azure OpenAI
- Azure AI Foundry

To use a custom or self-hosted model, implement the `self_deploy_query_function()` in [`inference.py`](https://github.com/MMTU-Benchmark/MMTU/blob/main/inference.py).

Example using Azure OpenAI:

```bash
python3 inference.py azure_openai \
    --endpoint https://<YOUR_DEPLOYMENT>.openai.azure.com \
    --api_key $AZURE_API_KEY \
    --model <MODEL_NAME> \
    --api_version 2024-08-01-preview
```

This step will:

- Download the dataset from Hugging Face 🤗
- Use the specified model to generate responses for each task
- Save two output files:
  - `mmtu.jsonl`: the evaluation dataset in JSONL format
  - `mmtu.jsonl.<MODEL_NAME>.result.jsonl`: the model’s responses to each task

### Step 3: Evaluation

After inference, evaluate your model’s outputs with:

```python
python3 evaluate.py mmtu.jsonl.<MODEL_NAME>.result.jsonl
```

This script will compute performance metrics for your model on the MMTU benchmark.

### Step 3 (Alternative): Evaluation with Docker

This directory contains Docker configuration files to run the `evaluate.py` script in an isolated container environment.

Please make sure that Docker is installed and is executable without root.

```bash
# Make the script executable (if not already done)
chmod +x run_evaluate_docker.sh

# Run evaluation on a result file
./run_evaluate_docker.sh mmtu.jsonl.<MODEL_NAME>.result.jsonl
```
## 🐳 Running on RunPod (or any GPU cloud)

If you're running on GPU cloud instances (e.g., RunPod), you don't want to spend GPU time installing dependencies. The solution is to pre-bake everything into Docker images.

### Setting up a Docker registry

You need a registry to push your images so RunPod can pull them. Here are your options:

**Option A: Docker Hub (simplest, free for public images)**

```bash
# 1. Create a free account at https://hub.docker.com
# 2. Log in from your terminal
docker login

# 3. Your registry is your Docker Hub username
export REGISTRY=docker.io/achithanar
```

**Option B: GitHub Container Registry (free for public, works with GitHub repos)**

```bash
# 1. Create a personal access token at https://github.com/settings/tokens
#    with "write:packages" scope

# 2. Log in
echo $GITHUB_TOKEN | docker login ghcr.io -u yourusername --password-stdin

# 3. Your registry is:
export REGISTRY=ghcr.io/yourusername
```

**Option C: Private registries (AWS ECR, GCP Artifact Registry, Azure ACR)**

These are better if you need private images. Follow your cloud provider's docs for authentication, then set `REGISTRY` accordingly.

### Building the images

We use a three-layer Docker setup so you only rebuild what changed:

```
┌─────────────────────────────────┐
│  mmtu-base:latest               │  ← CUDA + PyTorch + model weights
│  (Rarely changes, ~20GB)        │     Rebuild when upgrading PyTorch/model
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│  mmtu-llada:latest              │  ← Your LLaDA fork
│  (Changes when LLaDA changes)   │     Rebuild in ~seconds
├─────────────────────────────────┤
│  mmtu-runpod:latest             │  ← MMTU benchmark code
│  (Changes most often)           │     Rebuild in ~seconds
└─────────────────────────────────┘
```

Build all three with the provided script:

```bash
export REGISTRY=docker.io/achithanar   # your registry from above
export LLADA_DIR=~/projects/llada        # path to your LLaDA fork

# Build and push everything (first time)
./build_docker.sh all

# After that, rebuild only what changed:
./build_docker.sh mmtu     # changed MMTU code only
./build_docker.sh llada    # changed LLaDA fork (then also rebuild mmtu)
./build_docker.sh base     # upgraded PyTorch or model (then rebuild all)
```

### Running on RunPod

1. Create a new **Template** in RunPod pointing to your final image (`docker.io/achithanar/mmtu-runpod:latest`)
2. Launch a pod with that template (e.g., A100 40GB for LLaDA-8B)
3. Open a terminal and run:

```bash
# Quick test on 10 samples from one task
python3 inference.py self_deploy --tasks NL2SQL --max_samples_per_task 10

# Full benchmark
python3 inference.py self_deploy

# Evaluate
python3 evaluate.py mmtu.GSAI-ML/LLaDA-8B-Instruct.result.jsonl
```

The GPU starts working immediately since all deps and model weights are already in the image.

## 🔧 Extension: Customizing Table Tasks, Prompts, and Evaluation

Our framework is designed to be easily extensible. You can add new table tasks, customize prompt templates, and define your own evaluation metrics with minimal effort.

✨ Customizing Prompt Templates

To modify the prompt template for a specific task (e.g., NL2SQL), simply update the prompt_template in the corresponding configuration file.

1. Open the file: `configurations/NL2SQL/v1.0/ns_singletable_v1.0_sample1000_markdown.py`
2. Modify the `prompt_template` as desired.
3. Regenerate the prompts by running:

```bash
python3 build_data.py one --config configurations/NL2SQL/v1.0/ns_singletable_v1.0_sample1000_markdown.py
```
🧪 Adding Custom Evaluation Metrics
To introduce new evaluation metrics for a task (e.g., NL2SQL), modify the _evaluate_one method in the relevant evaluator class.

For example:

- Edit the `NSEvaluator` class in `evaluators/nl2sql.py`
- Update the `_evaluate_one` function to include your custom metric logic.
